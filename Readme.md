## VirtualClickBot

VirtualClickBot is a tool to record and replay tasks inside VM, controlled from outside. It was developed for automation of those tasks, that are hard to automate using approaches such as Selenium. VirtualClickBot is focused on simulating mouse movements and keyboard input on the OS.


## Getting started

 * Install [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
 * Copy the VM.py inside the VM, start it with python
 * Start the main.py on any system in reach of the VM (e.g. locally)

## Whatâ€™s next?

Feel free to add comments, issues or commit your own extentions. This project is ment to grow and replace al the horrible "AutoClicker"-Malware. Support for Linux and complete WinAPI in progress.
